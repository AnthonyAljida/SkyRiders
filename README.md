# SkyRiders
A 2D side scroller inspired by flappy bird coded and created in Eclipse using Java Swing GUI

While following the youtube tutorial with credit to Jaryt to create the Flappy Bird game, I gained valuable insights and learned several key concepts in game development. Some of my major learnings include: 
Bird and pipe graphics faithful to the original Flappy Bird game.
Gravity and jump mechanics, allowing the player to navigate the bird through the pipes.
Collision detection to detect when the bird hits the ground or pipes.
Score tracking and display, challenging the player to achieve a high score.
Game over functionality and restart option to provide a seamless gaming experience.

I also gained valuable experience working with a team setting and conducting set time blocks for working together as a team.
